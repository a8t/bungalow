# Andy × Bungalow DRF App

> ### A sample codebase using Django + DRF. To get Andy hired!

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. [Install the `pipenv` tool](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation) if necessary.
3. Install dependencies:

```
pipenv install
```

4. Activate the project's virtualenv:

```
pipenv shell
```

You're good to go! That was much easier than last time I tried installing Python.

Also, when you're done with the virtualenv shell, you can kill it with command `exit` or by pressing `Ctrl+D`.
